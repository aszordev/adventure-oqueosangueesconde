Love turns into hungry obsession, while friendship becomes bitter jealousy. In place of emotion, vampires pursue physical symbols of what they crave, so that a vampire seeking love might fixate on a young beauty. A child might become an object of fascination for a vampire obsessed with youth and potential.

His brother Sergei came to live with him in Castle Ravenloft, becoming Strahd's adviser and constant companion.</p><p>In his brother, Strahd saw everything he had lost.
